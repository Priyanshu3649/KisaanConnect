    "organics.faq2a": "Key challenges include managing pests and weeds without synthetic chemicals, lower initial yields during the transition period, and potentially higher labor costs. However, organic produce often commands higher prices in the market.",
    "organics.faq3q": "Can I use cow dung as fertilizer?",
    "organics.faq3a": "Yes, composted cow dung is an excellent organic fertilizer. Raw manure should be composted for at least 3-4 months before application to kill pathogens and weed seeds.",
    "organics.faq4q": "What is crop rotation and why is it important?",
