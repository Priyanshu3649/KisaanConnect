    "organics.faq3q": "Can I use cow dung as fertilizer?",
    "organics.faq3a": "Yes, composted cow dung is an excellent organic fertilizer. Raw manure should be composted for at least 3-4 months before application to kill pathogens and weed seeds.",
    "organics.faq4q": "What is crop rotation and why is it important?",
